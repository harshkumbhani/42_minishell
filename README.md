## Features
- **Command Execution:** Ability to execute standard Unix/Bash commands.
- **Built-in commands:** Includes multiple built-ins such as:
  - `cd` with only a relative or absolute path.
  - `pwd` with no options.
  - `echo` with option -n.
  - `env` with no options or arguments.
  - `exit` with no options.
  - `unset` with no options.
  - `export` with no options.
- **Command History:** Keeps track of previous commands by using the up & down arrow keys.
- **Expansion:** Our program interprets and handles environment variable expansion within quotes. Within single quotes its interpreted as a literal value while in double quotes it expands (if its a valid `env` variable), mirroring Bash's behaviour. It also supports expansion in heredocs.
- **Signal Handling:** Includes features like interrupt (`Ctrl+C`), quit (`Ctrl+\`), and EOF (`Ctrl+D`). The signals behave similar to bash.
- **Error Handling:** Includes protection for `malloc()`, `pipe()`, `fork()` and more. It also provides clear error messages (E.g. command not found, syntax error, no permission, malloc fail etc..).
- **Redirection And Piping:** Supports intput, output, heredoc, and append redirection (`>`, `<`, `<<`, `>>`). It also supports piping (`|`) allow to command chaining.
- **Memory Management:** Our program frees and  cleansup any memory/file descriptors upon termination, ensuring system stability.
- **Tab Completion:** Auto complete file names by using tab. Also by pressing tab in the prompt displays the current directories files/folders.
- **Documentation:** All functions have doxygen comments to ensure readability and to better understand the underlying logic at a glance.
